            Have you ever wanted to design a CPU with Paint? Well now you can!
        </div><div>
            aspng lets you draw out transistor-level digital circuits using
            pixels, and then simulate (and interact with!) those circuits.
        </div><div>
            To give you an idea of what's possible, here's a full ripple adder:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use the switches on the left and right to change the input.
                </li><li>
                    The switch in the middle/top is for the input carry bit.
                </li><li>
                    The result (and the output carry bit) is conveyed with the
                    LEDs in the middle.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="/aspng/full_ripple_adder.js"></script>
        <canvas id="canvas1" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()" tabindex=-1></canvas>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            Module({
                preRun: [],
                postRun: [],
                print: function(s) { console.log("wasm: " + s); },
                printErr: function(s) { console.log("wasm: " + s); },
                canvas: (function() {
                    var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas1");
                    // TODO, should make this more robust.
                    canvas.addEventListener("webglcontextlost", function(e) {
                        console.log("WebGL context lost");
                        e.preventDefault();
                    });
                    return canvas;
                })(),

            });
        </script>
        <div>
            (Note: if your browser doesn't support WASM, you will see a black
            square here.  Sorry! TODO link to later instructions on how to run
            locally)
        </div>

        <div class="header" id="design-guide">Design guide</div>
        <div>
            First, your background must be entirely black (#000000).
            aspng ignores black pixels.
        </div><div>
            Source pixels are white (#ffffff) and drive a high voltage. Sink
            pixels are dark gray (#303030) and drive a low voltage.
        </div><div>
            It is an error to connect a source to a sink directly.
        </div><div>
            Bridge pixels (#79443b) allow you to cross wires without connecting
            them.
        </div><div>
            Transistor pixels (#ff00f2) let themselves be connected on three
            sides with copper, forming a T. The copper forming the cross of the
            T conducts if the third lead is driven high, otherwise it does not
            conduct.
        </div><div>
            You can create pull-ups and pull-downs using a yellow (#fff200)
            pixel paired with either a source or a sink. These "weak" sources
            and sinks drive a high or low voltage, but can be overruled by the
            presence of a conventional source or sink.
        </div><div>
            Finally, as you've seen, there are a few "template devices" such as
            input, switch, and LED. These must be reproduced exactly as shown
            or aspng will not recognize them.
        </div>

        <div class="header" id="why-aspng">Why does this exist? .. and design decisions</div>
        <div>
            ASICs are crazy complicated. Every ASIC is a careful arrangement of
            n- and/or p-channel MOSFETs, pullups, pulldowns, clocks, latches,
            etc., implementing arbitrarily complicated relationships between
            input and output pins.
        </div><div>
            And yet, in the early days all decisions about the logic and the
            layout of these circuits were made by humans, and the lithography
            masks were drawn out by hand.  Microprocessors like the Intel 4004
            and the MOS 6502 were designed this way.
        </div><div>
            Today, digital ASICs are much too large and complicated to be
            designed by humans. Instead, hardware description languages like
            Verilog or VHDL are used to describe the behavior of the ASIC, and
            then very heavily researched computer programs figure out the exact
            layout of physical devices to realize the design ("logic
            synthesis").
        </div><div>
            aspng exists so that I can attempt to experience, and capture some
            of the satisfaction those early ASIC designers must have felt when
            their artisanal circuits worked.
        </div><div>
            At the same time, I don't have a lifetime of experience managing
            power consumption, switching delays, parasitic capacitances,
            capacitance delays, leakage, and so on that true ASIC designers
            must have to make a functioning circuit. I'm lazy! I just want the
            fun parts that make me feel smart.
        </div><div>
            For the sake of keeping "ASIC design" fun (?) and feasible for the
            amateur, aspng greatly simplifies all electrical properties:
            <ul>
                <li>Resistance does not exist.</li>
                <li>Capacitance does not exist.</li>
                <li>Inductance does not exist.</li>
                <li>Voltage is either "floating", "low", or "high".</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
