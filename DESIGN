Parsing
-------

An image has been "parsed" when every pixel in the image has been assigned to
some device. Including the background -- it's assigned to an inert
BackgroundDevices. For clarity's sake, the background pixels/devices are left
out of the figures in this document.

```

                         id | device type
                         ----------------
                         1  | A
                         2  | B
                         3  | A
                         4  | C
                         5  | C
                         6  | D
```

The `aspng` parser, as implemented, only does one pass over the image. For each
unclaimed pixel, starting from the top left, the parser asks each Device type D
to try to parse out a device starting from that pixel. If D is successful, then
the parser assigns all the pixels that D has claimed to D. If any unclaimed
pixel remains at the end of the pass, then that is an error.

To deal with overlapping parse results, the parser chooses the parse that is a
proper superset of the other. If there is no such parse, that is considered a
failing of the grammar and the parser exits. This is how PullDevices and
{Sink,Source}Devices can coexist, because if a PullDevice parse exists then it
is always a proper superset of the {Sink,Source}Device parse.

Linking
-------

After parsing, we know which devices are in the image. But there is nothing to
simulate until we know how those devices are connected.

This process is called linking. Considering a subset of the figure from before,
the result that we want from linking is one "port" between the devices 1 and 2,
illustrated with # and % signs:

```
raw                    parsed                    linked
---                    ------                    ------

@@@@@@@@               11111111                  11111111
@@@@@@@@               11111111                  11111111
@@@@@@@@*****          1111111122222             1111111#%2222

@@@@@@@@*****    ->    1111111122222       ->    1111111#%2222
@@@@@@@@   **          11111111   22             11111111   22
@@@@@@@@   **          11111111   22             11111111   22
@@@@@@@@               11111111                  11111111

                       id | device type
                       ----------------
                       1  | A
                       2  | B
```

The # and % signs, taken together, are the "port". The # signs are those pixels
comprising the port which are contained in device 1, and the % signs are those
contained in device 2. The reason this distinction is important is that each
device will decide how to interact with this port based on where the port
touches the device.

The way `aspng` does the linking process is by first finding the longest
contiguous patches where two devices touch. Then, each device is queried to
find out whether it is legal for it to be touching the other device -- if one
or both devices do not allow the port, then that is a linking error.

Simulation
----------

Simulation in `aspng` follows the clock. A simulation step looks like this:

1. Flip the clock value from - -> + or + -> - .

2. Group all devices into "nets". A device is in the same "net" as another if
the two devices are reachable through any number of ports (passing through
other devices). Devices decide how their ports relate to one another -- for
example, a transistor will connect two ports if and only if the third port (the
gate) is "+". Note that a device can be in multiple nets.

3. Determine the total value of each net, given the states of the devices
inside of it:
* if mix of + and -: error
* if there is any +: +
* if there is any -: -
* if there is any SRC: +
* if there is any SNK: -
* otherwise, "float.

4. If any port value changed, return to step 2. If we have done "too many"
iterations and we don't think the simulation will converge, then error.
