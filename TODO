add CapacitorDevice

add DRAM example

add tests for all the new devices I added
   .. need to add click infrastructure

convert remaining size_t -> int32_t

remove Device::name, needs to be virtual to work anyway

let devices also report why they didn't parse - for debug purposes

rename all_patches -> all_patches_to_own

"virtual Rgb get_draw_color(Patch *);Â¶" in CopperDevice and others seems pointless (virtual)

all size_t (for Coord) -> int32_t
  (will need to add more asserts for >0)

do zooming / panning better:
    when zoom, should pan to keep cursor centered
    when pan, should be normalized to zoom level
    handle window resize by panning/zooming

all () -> (void)

*AspngSurface -> *Surface

use more const in the right places

something is wrong with the tests - how did the "uninitialized color_for_drawing" issue get by?

SDL display using geometry instead of textures -- for sampling

SDL display (later also for input)

with "$N_" ... just organize the tests better with subfolders and stuff too

* add tests for transistor - note, multiple in-series transistors should settle in one 'tick'
   -- or should they? -- and what if there are racing transistors, what should the behavior be

should esbtalish the order in which tests are run - numerical order? all directories must start

finish up the DESIGN doc

improve "link fail" messages -- e.g. the fail transistors should say "not enough.."

valgrind should be a test

Png library is a mess, fix it

snakecase -> camelCase

remove printf from all (include common.h)

split up test into ParserLinker, etc

google C++ style guide

use range-based iterators when it makes sense

use stringbuffers instead of +'ing up string components..
